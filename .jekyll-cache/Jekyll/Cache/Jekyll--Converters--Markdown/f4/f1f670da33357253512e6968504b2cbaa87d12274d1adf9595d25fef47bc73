<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This week weâ€™re moving on to Oligopolies, that is, markets in which firms share market power. There are two main types of competitive models: competition in outputs and competition in prices. Remarkably, these two models lead to vastly different predictions for market outcomes. We are going to learn about the relationship between these models and perfect competition, market concentration, and consider extensions in which firms make their choices sequentially.</p>
