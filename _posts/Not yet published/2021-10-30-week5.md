## Overview

This week we're moving on to Oligopolies, that is, markets in which firms share market power. There are two main types of competitive models: competition in outputs and competition in prices. Remarkably, these two models lead to vastly different predictions for market outcomes. We are going to learn about the relationship between these models and perfect competition, market concentration, and consider extensions in which firms make their choices sequentially.


- Readings (supplementary, not mandatory)
  - Pepall et al., Part III
  - Belleflamme &amp; Peitz, Chpt. 3 &amp; 4
- Learning Objectives
  - Understand the strategic considerations of firms in different types of competition (price, output, simultaneous, sequential)
  - Compare the model predictions to that of monopoly and perfect competition benchmarks
  - Solve for equilibria in each of these models
  - Learn how to adapt the models to novel environments
